				<h2>I'm Kevin "The Zhangster" Zhang.</h2>

				<div class="row">

					<div class="col-md-8">

						<p>I was always an interesting one growing up. Born in Houston, Texas, I'm told I was completely silent in my childhood, armed with chubby legs and a strong propensity for curiosity, sometimes learning things the hard way. Then come pre-K, I flip-flopped and became a loud, hungry individual. I started eating tons and talking a lot more, but my curiosity never wavered. Moving into grade school, I gradually became more and more outspoken, and I towered above my friends as a lanky beacon of laughter and silliness. Students in high school always talk about the grade school triangle: Sleep, Friends, or Knowledge, you can really only achieve two of the three. I chose to gun for all of them, and it was tough, but life isn't fun without a challenge. I graduated high school Top 5 of my class with straight As, was known as "The Zhangster", famous for his loudness, bright laughter, and reliability, and never had dark circles under my eyes, not even once. </p>

						<p>Now a senior at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, I continue to be the curious cat I always was, now just less loud. I immerse myself in my studies, discovering a passion in robotics and software. I decided that the traditional computing major at my college wasn't fit for my interests, so I merged two career trees into one to make my own major, Computational Robotics. I now work hard to learn all that I can about both computer science and artificial intelligence for mobile robots. </p>

						<p>As my major suggests, I do have an extensive software background. I have now taken 4 years of formal training in programming using Java, and I have also taken 3 years of college level software courses in Python. In addition, I have taken a year of college level courses for C and C++, and have taken 3+ years of data structures and algorithms courses, plus self studying. Besides coding, I am also very familiar with many robotics topics, including machine learning, simulation, computer vision, mobile robotic planning, and sensor fusion. I am also an extremely fast learner: I taught myself Reinforcement Learning to a proficient level in less than a year and actively learned full stack web development from scratch during an internship and applied it all immediately to complete a project. I am constantly engaged in self-learning and am always looking for a fun, challenging endeavor to work on. </p>

						"I've known Kevin for a few years and had the pleasure of working with him throughout the summer of 2017. He interned with my team at nuTonomy and immediately jumped in with meaningful contributions across many of our team's projects. Kevin demonstrated an interest, ability, and motivation to develop and test advanced robotics software. He consistently took it upon himself to seek out challenging problems. He developed software to monitor and validate computer and sensor systems on-board our autonomous vehicles. This software helps our operations teams maintain global fleet health.

						I sincerely enjoyed my time working with Kevin for his independence, responsibility, honest feedback, and work ethic. Moreover, he is very kind and personable with a pleasant sense of humor; he would make a strong addition to your engineering team. Thanks Kevin!"

						<p>Most recently, I have interned at Amazon Robotics, a more modern, agile subsidary of the larger Amazon whose goal is to automate fulfillment centers. I was given the opportunity to work at a large company with global scale impact, completing a project that held a stake in over 2TB of data and $20 million daily in company value. Furthermore, I also self-initiated a few learning-based capabilities within my team's infrastructure for use in predicting future trends. </p>
                        <p> In the past, my endeavors have led me to intern at nuTonomy, a bustling startup with a vision to revolutionize urban transporation through their software, nuCore, a system designed to put autonomous cars on the road. There, I was so far ahead of my main project schedule that I self-initiated my own side projects, including optimizing a section of the codebase for efficiency and introducing a new planning model to the planning team pipeline. </p>
                        <p> Even as a freshman in college, I have worked for Ivani, a startup company in Missouri that specializes in network presence sensing technology and home automation. There, I interned as a Software Development Engineer and exceeded project expectations to patent a new presence sensing technology. </p>
                        <p>Presently, I am involved in a multitude of activities at Olin, such as Olin Robotics, Olin Aquaponics, and Olin Ultimate. I also compete in Hackathons and continue to work on side projects, such as learning graphic design, creating my own Jarvis home system, and building a personal cooking assistant for my adventures in the kitchen.  </p>

						<p>Outside my studies and academics, I've grown to adopt a number of hobbies and personal interests. I like to have fun with friends and make them laugh. I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee with our college team, and I have recently found a passion for cooking and trying new foods. (Check out my instagram for my adventures in "Kevin's quest to become a better chef" @kzhang8850 #shamelessplug). I also like to explore various cool events around campus, such as Co-Curriculars, fun no credit classes where professors teach others about their hobbies, which include pottery and fermentation. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and tennis, listening to music, keeping up to date about the latest news in the software and robotics circles, and keeping on the lookout for the passerby chicken (I started eating a lot of chicken and then one day it became my spirit animal).</p>

						"I first met Kevin Zhang during 2017 internship program at nuTonomy
						inc. Initially, he joined 'team car', in which he focused on
						automating car operations and troubleshooting processes, but his
						interest quickly grew to other advanced algorithms used for autonomous
						driving... As a senior research scientist at the motion planning and
						controls team, I suggested Kevin to work on an extra project after the completion of his primary assignment. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly Kevin made progress on his new
						assignment. Although Kevin just finished his sophomore year in Olin
						college, he was able to understand in great details concepts that are
						typically introduced in graduate-level robotics courses. Moreover, it
						seems natural for Kevin to learn by doing, and during the month of us
						working together he implemented a game-theoretic approach for
						navigating an autonomous car in traffic. As a bonus, he proposed a
						machine learning algorithm for computing the optimal lane merging
						strategy.

						Based on my observations of Kevin's progress during his internship at
						nuTonomy, I can say with confidence that he will be a valuable
						addition to our team as well as any team of motivated engineers... Kevin is also a very personable and kind fellow, and it was a pleasure to work with him."

						<p> As for what's next in my life, a college student's future is always quite volatile. But I do know that I plan on pursuing artificial intelligence and mobile robotics as my career path. I know that I plan on searching for more endeavors to work on, and that I plan on leading the Olin Robotics team to greatness. I know that I will continue to strive to learn everything I can, because I'll always be a curious cat. I know that I will continue to chase after chickens and experiment in the kitchen. And no matter how hard I try otherwise, I know that I'll always be "The Zhangster", famous for his (now ocassional) loudness and bright laughter, and the guy you can always depend on.</p>
